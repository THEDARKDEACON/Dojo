# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The robot_perception package is failing to launch properly in the Gazebo simulation due to installation/packaging issues. The package builds successfully but the executables are not properly installed in the expected ROS2 directory structure, causing the launch system to fail with the error: "libexec directory '/root/Dojo/install/robot_perception/lib/robot_perception' does not exist".

This feature will fix the robot_perception package installation and ensure it works correctly with the complete simulation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a robotics developer, I want the robot_perception package to install correctly so that the complete simulation can run without crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the robot_perception package is built THEN the executables SHALL be properly installed in the lib/robot_perception directory
2. WHEN the complete_simulation.launch.py is run THEN robot_perception SHALL launch without errors
3. WHEN robot_perception is running THEN it SHALL subscribe to camera topics and publish detection results
4. IF the installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific issue

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a robotics developer, I want the object detection functionality to work in simulation so that I can test perception algorithms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the camera publishes image data THEN robot_perception SHALL process the images
2. WHEN objects are detected THEN robot_perception SHALL publish detection results to appropriate topics
3. WHEN running in debug mode THEN robot_perception SHALL log detection information
4. WHEN no objects are detected THEN robot_perception SHALL continue running without errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a robotics developer, I want the robot_perception package to integrate seamlessly with the existing simulation so that all components work together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the complete simulation is launched THEN robot_perception SHALL start automatically with other components
2. WHEN robot_perception is running THEN it SHALL not interfere with SLAM, control, or visualization components
3. WHEN the simulation is stopped THEN robot_perception SHALL shut down cleanly
4. WHEN robot_perception fails THEN it SHALL not cause the entire simulation to crash

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a robotics developer, I want proper ROS2 package structure so that the package follows best practices and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is built THEN it SHALL follow standard ROS2 Python package structure
2. WHEN executables are installed THEN they SHALL be accessible via ros2 run commands
3. WHEN the package is installed THEN all entry points SHALL be properly configured
4. WHEN dependencies are checked THEN all required packages SHALL be available
