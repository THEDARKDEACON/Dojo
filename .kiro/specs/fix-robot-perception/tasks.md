# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix setup.py configuration for proper ROS2 installation
  - Simplify setup.py by removing custom symlink creation logic
  - Use standard ROS2 Python package entry_points configuration
  - Ensure executables install in correct lib/robot_perception/ directory
  - Test basic package installation with colcon build
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Verify and fix package dependencies
  - Check package.xml for all required dependencies
  - Ensure Python dependencies are properly declared in setup.py
  - Test import statements in both camera_processor.py and object_detector.py
  - Add missing dependencies if any are found
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 2.4_

- [ ] 3. Create installation verification script
  - Write script to check if executables exist in expected locations
  - Verify ros2 run commands work for both nodes
  - Test basic node functionality (initialization and shutdown)
  - Create automated test for package installation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 4.2_

- [ ] 4. Test individual perception nodes
  - Test camera_processor node with simulated camera data
  - Test object_detector node with test images
  - Verify topic publishing and subscribing works correctly
  - Test error handling for missing camera topics
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Update launch file integration
  - Modify complete_simulation.launch.py to properly handle perception failures
  - Add conditional launching for robot_perception
  - Implement graceful degradation if perception fails to start
  - Test launch file with and without perception enabled
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 1.2_

- [ ] 6. Integration testing with complete simulation
  - Test robot_perception with full Gazebo simulation
  - Verify camera topics are properly connected
  - Test object detection functionality in simulation environment
  - Ensure perception doesn't interfere with SLAM or control
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 7. Add debug and monitoring capabilities
  - Implement debug logging for perception nodes
  - Add topic monitoring to verify data flow
  - Create diagnostic script to check perception status
  - Test error recovery scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 1.4, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Final validation and cleanup
  - Run complete simulation with all components enabled
  - Verify clean shutdown of all perception nodes
  - Test multiple launch/shutdown cycles
  - Document any remaining limitations or known issues
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4, 1.3_
