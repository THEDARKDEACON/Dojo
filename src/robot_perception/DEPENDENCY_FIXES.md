# Dependency Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed package dependencies for robot_perception to ensure proper installation and functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated setup.py
**File**: `src/robot_perception/setup.py`
**Changes**:
- Added `opencv-python` to `install_requires`
- Added `numpy` to `install_requires`
- These ensure Python dependencies are properly installed during package installation

### 2. Updated package.xml
**File**: `src/robot_perception/package.xml`
**Changes**:
- Added `builtin_interfaces` dependency
- This ensures all ROS2 message interfaces are available

### 3. Improved object_detector.py
**File**: `src/robot_perception/robot_perception/object_detector.py`
**Changes**:
- Enhanced Haar cascade loading with better error checking
- Added verification that cascade loaded correctly
- Improved error handling for missing cascade files

### 4. Created verification tools
**Files**:
- `src/robot_perception/test_dependencies.py` - Script to test all imports
- `src/robot_perception/DEPENDENCIES.md` - Documentation of all dependencies

## Verification

All import statements in both nodes have been verified:

### camera_processor.py imports:
✓ rclpy and related modules
✓ sensor_msgs.msg (Image, CameraInfo)
✓ cv_bridge (CvBridge, CvBridgeError)
✓ cv2 (OpenCV)
✓ numpy
✓ geometry_msgs.msg (Point)

### object_detector.py imports:
✓ rclpy and related modules
✓ sensor_msgs.msg (Image)
✓ std_msgs.msg (String)
✓ geometry_msgs.msg (Point)
✓ cv_bridge (CvBridge, CvBridgeError)
✓ cv2 (OpenCV)
✓ numpy
✓ json (built-in)

## Requirements Addressed

- **Requirement 4.4**: All required packages are now properly declared in package.xml
- **Requirement 2.4**: Python dependencies are properly declared in setup.py and all import statements have been verified

## Next Steps

The package should now build and install correctly with all dependencies available. The next task should focus on installation verification and testing.
