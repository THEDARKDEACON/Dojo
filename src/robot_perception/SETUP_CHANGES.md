# Robot Perception Setup.py Changes

## Summary of Changes Made

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the robot_perception package installation issues.

## Problem
The original setup.py had complex custom symlink creation logic that was causing installation failures. The error was:
```
libexec directory '/root/Dojo/install/robot_perception/lib/robot_perception' does not exist
```

## Solution
Simplified the setup.py to use standard ROS2 Python package configuration without custom symlink logic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Custom Symlink Logic
- Removed `PostDevelopCommand` and `PostInstallCommand` classes
- Removed `create_symlinks()` function
- Removed custom `cmdclass` configuration

### 2. Simplified Package Configuration
- Used standard `find_packages()` instead of manual package listing
- Removed complex installation logic
- Kept only essential `install_requires` (setuptools)

### 3. Standard ROS2 Entry Points
- Maintained proper `console_scripts` entry points:
  - `camera_processor = robot_perception.camera_processor:main`
  - `object_detector = robot_perception.object_detector:main`

### 4. Preserved ROS2 Data Files
- Kept standard ROS2 data files configuration
- Maintained launch and config file installation
- Preserved package.xml and resource file installation

## Before (Problematic)
```python
class PostDevelopCommand(develop):
    def run(self):
        develop.run(self)
        self.create_symlinks()

def create_symlinks():
    # Complex symlink creation logic...
    
setup(
    cmdclass={
        'develop': PostDevelopCommand,
        'install': PostInstallCommand,
    },
    # ... rest of config
)
```

## After (Fixed)
```python
setup(
    name=package_name,
    version='0.1.0',
    packages=find_packages(exclude=['test']),
    # Standard ROS2 configuration without custom logic
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'camera_processor = robot_perception.camera_processor:main',
            'object_detector = robot_perception.object_detector:main',
        ],
    },
)
```

## Expected Results
With these changes, the package should:
1. Build successfully with `colcon build --packages-select robot_perception`
2. Install executables in the correct `lib/robot_perception/` directory
3. Allow `ros2 run robot_perception camera_processor` to work
4. Allow `ros2 run robot_perception object_detector` to work
5. Integrate properly with launch files

## Verification
Run the verification script to check the configuration:
```bash
cd src/robot_perception
python3 verify_setup.py
```

## Requirements Addressed
- ✅ 1.1: Executables properly installed in lib/robot_perception directory
- ✅ 4.1: Standard ROS2 Python package structure
- ✅ 4.3: Entry points properly configured
